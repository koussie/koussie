## 👋 Hi, I’m Djougoune

I’m a final-year Computer Science student at Université Laval, with a strong interest in software engineering and backend development.  
I currently have hands-on experience building real-world applications through academic projects and professional work in a public-sector environment.

I enjoy working on clean, well-structured systems, especially APIs, backend services, and application architecture.  
I’m curious by nature, always learning, and I like understanding *why* things work, not just how.

I love solving problems related to both back-end and front-end development, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find projects ranging from backend systems to full-stack experiments, where I focus on code quality, maintainability, and real use cases.

📫 Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out if you’d like to connect.
